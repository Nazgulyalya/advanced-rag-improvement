Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, improves glycemic control and weight but is limited by gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, notably nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which impair adherence. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), a non-invasive therapy, shows potential in alleviating gastrointestinal symptoms, yet its role in mitigating semaglutide-related side effects and enhancing drug efficacy remains unexplored. A total of 60 T2DM participants experiencing semaglutide-induced GI side effects will be randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. The control group will receive semaglutide (0.25 mg weekly) plus sham-taVNS, with electrodes attached to the bilateral auricular scapha at 4/20 Hz for 30 min, twice daily.

Despite good evidence for reduced mortality on statins and decades of promotion, population uptake globally is less than 3%, and only around 10% even in the United Kingdom and the United States. Statins remain the only cholesterol-lowering drug class shown to improve survival, albeit only in symptomatic coronary patients and on mid-range doses. Population studies have consistently shown that coronary events and mortality are lower the lower the serum total cholesterol concentration. However, below 5 mmol/L (low-density lipoprotein, LDL, cholesterol around 3.5 mmol/L), the population studies show that total mortality begins to rise.

Ten formerly vaccine-hesitant Hispanic parents developed digital stories about their reasons for vaccinating their child(ren) against COVID-19. We then enrolled 80 Hispanic parents whose children were not up to date with COVID-19 vaccines in a randomized feasibility trial. Intervention group participants ( Qualitative data suggested that DST was an acceptable and engaging method of health education.

Instead of estimating total deaths averted by vaccination among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, some studies empirically estimated only \"directly averted\" deaths among vaccinated individuals, typically suggesting that vaccines prevented more deaths overall than directly due to the indirect effect. Here, we define the causal estimand to quantify outcomes \"directly averted\" by vaccination-i.e., the impact of vaccination for vaccinated individuals, holding vaccination coverage fixed-for vaccination at multiple time points, and show that this estimand is a lower bound on the total outcomes averted when the indirect effect is non-negative.

Dysregulated ribosome biogenesis is a recognized driver of tumorigenesis and therapy resistance, but its comprehensive impact on AML prognosis and the immune microenvironment remains to be fully elucidated. We constructed an AML single-cell atlas and quantified ribosome biogenesis activity. A prognostic ribosome biogenesis signature (RBS) was developed through integrated machine learning and interpreted using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. We evaluated the RBS associations with prognosis, tumor immune microenvironment, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity. Key findings were validated by qPCR, Western blot, and molecular docking. Single-cell analysis revealed significantly elevated ribosome biogenesis activity scores (RAS, a composite metric quantifying cellular ribosome synthesis capacity) in AML stem and ",

    "abstract": "The role of hyperthermia (HT) in conventional oncological treatment has been a subject of research for decades; however, HT has not been incorporated into treatment guidelines on a universal basis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the mechanism of action of HT and have indicated a clear effect that can enhance the effects of radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. The underlying mechanism of HTs action involves either the enhancement of the immune system response or the interference with crucial cellular pathways that are aberrantly altered during the neoplastic process. Consequently, HT has the potential to augment the efficacy of RT treatments markedly. Randomized clinical trials have further demonstrated the efficacy and safety of combining RT and HT. However, it is important to note that the majority of these observations were derived from studies conducted up to two decades ago, which may not fully reflect the current standard of care.

We sought to identify genetic drivers of RH in a reliable and generalizable manner. We utilized FinnGen (discovery) and UKBB (UK Biobank, replication) data sets to identify potential genetic drivers of RH. Using standard RH definitions, we developed cohorts in each data set and performed genome-wide (genome-wide association studies) and transcriptome-wide association studies, as well as Mendelian randomization analysis to evaluate potential causal associations. We replicated 5 genetic loci in We identified distinct genetic variants associated with RH, including those implicating the role of hyperaldosteronism, highlighting distinct pathways and targets for more effectively treating RH.",

Participants who completed the placebo-controlled period were eligible for the 78-week, double-blind, long-term extension (LTE). Early-start participants were randomized to donanemab in the placebo-controlled period. Delayed-start participants (randomized to placebo) started donanemab in the LTE. Participants who met amyloid treatment course completion criteria were switched to placebo. An external control cohort comprised participants from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). At 3 years, donanemab slowed disease progression on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) in early-start participants versus a weighted ADNI control (-1.2 points; 95 % confidence interval [CI], -1.7, -0.7). Seventy-six weeks after initiating donanemab, delayed-start participants also demonstrated slower CDR",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and glycemic control have a bidirectional association. Understanding the impact of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) vs self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is important for treating older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) and diabetes that is treated with insulin. To compare the risks of glycemic outcomes and related adverse events between CGM users and prevalent SMBG users in insulin-treated older adults with ADRD and diabetes. This retrospective, prevalent-new user cohort study utilized a nationwide, 15% random sample of Medicare claims data (Parts A, B, and D) from January 2016 to December 2020 to ensure balanced cohorts. Insulin-treated older adults (≥66 years) with ADRD and diabetes were included. Individuals in hospice care or with a professional CGM use were excluded. Analysis was carried out from August 2023 to December 2024. Therapeutic CGM use vs prevalent SMBG use. Primary outcomes included hypoglycemia hospitalizations, hy",

    "title": "Evaluating amyloid-beta as a surrogate endpoint in trials of anti-amyloid-beta drugs in Alzheimer's disease: a Bayesian meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "What is this article about? Some treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been approved by regulators based on their ability to reduce levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ), a protein that builds up in the brains of people with AD. However, it remains unclear whether lowering Aβ actually leads to meaningful benefits for patients. In this study, we investigate whether changes in Aβ levels can reliably predict clinical benefit, using evidence from randomized controlled trials of anti-Aβ drugs. What were the results? We found that changes in Aβ may be a good predictor of clinical benefits, measured by a test called Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB), which assesses thinking ability and daily functioning. This relationship was observed when looking at combined data from all anti-Aβ drugs. However, the association did not hold consistently for individual drugs. Using a statistical method that enables information sharing across drugs, we observed a moderate association between A",

Trial populations will comprise many types of demographic and biological subgroups, including individuals of different sexes, groups of older and younger individuals, participants with or without the apolipoprotein E ε4 ( Clinical trials are sized to allow well-powered conclusions based on analysis of the entire participating population.Trial populations geared to be representative of the subgroups of the older population with AD are underpowered to allow drawing confident conclusions about efficacy or safety in subgroups.Strategies such as non-inferiority analysis combined with transparent reporting of the analytic framework may facilitate understanding treatment efficacy and safety in subgroups.",
